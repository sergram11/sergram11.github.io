    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Currently in a PhD program to develop my biotechnological skillset and improve the bio-manufacturing industry. 
      Seeking to leverage my strong background in molecular biology and macroalgae research to work on pioneering research 
      in microbial and cellular engineering. After acquiring my PhD, I aspire to work in industry and eventually start a biotechnology company 
      tackling global challenges in health and the environment.
