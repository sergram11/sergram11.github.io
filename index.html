    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Currently in a PhD program to develop my biotechnological skillset and improve the bio-manufacturing industry. Seeking to leverage my strong background in molecular biology and macroalgae research to work on pioneering research in microbial and cellular engineering. After acquiring my PhD, I would like to work in industry and potentially start my own biotechnology company tackling global challenges such as health or the environment. </p>

    <h2>Career Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>Utah State University, PhD in Biological Engineering	 Logan, UT
Graduate Research Assistantship 	May 2025 - Present	
Working in Lukas Buecherl's Synthetic BioSystems lab involves basic laboratory skills such as, laboratory design, management, standard operating procedures, procedure optimization, public speaking, weekly communication, and other common soft skills found in graduate programs.
The lab focuses specifically on optimizing genetic circuit design. This work is aiding the transition of biotechnology from the ‘Stone-Age’ of genetic engineering projects that can take decades to the ‘Industrial-Age’ of modular synthetic biology platforms, with interchangeable parts, computational design, assembly, and validation; creating shorter pipelines to biotechnological products that are reproducible, scalable, and require less technical background to implement. We’re building the ‘engineering’ in bioengineering. 
Independent PhD research project: Improving cellular robustness for bio-manufacturing. </p>
      <p>Climate Foundation 	(Remote) Denver, CO
Climate Fellow	Dec 2023 - Present 
Working at a non-profit/startup studio dedicated to novel solutions for climate change. Grant seeker, writer, and manager. Developed my own research project. 
Identified and applied to multiple grant making organizations - Blue Planet Fund, NASA, Bezos Fund, MIT Solve, Elemental, EPA, Advanced Research and Innovation Agency, and Johnson Ohana Foundation. 
Co-authoring publication on Submersible Platforms for Offshore Seaweed Cultivation in Springer book - Large Floating Solutions: Design, Construction and Legality of Offshore Structures and Buoyant Urbanism. 
Developed project management skills, team leadership abilities, graphic design skills, and cross-organization communication and leadership skills. 
Utilized AI tools to develop a grant writing pipeline to improve the quality and number of grant applications possible.</p>
  <p>STEM Muse 	(Remote) Denver, CO
Mentorship Coordinator	July 2024 - November 2024
Worked at a startup providing a mentorship program to graduate students at University of Texas Austin and Rice University. Connected with mentors from industry and academia to pair with mentee requests. 
Researched and identified key leaders, and individuals with expertise that matched student interests for mentorship. Performed outreach with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, emails, and events.
Maintained organization system for applicants (mentors + mentees) through Zoho and Airtable. Developed skills in customer relationship management tools.  </p>
      <p>Center for Cellular Construction, UCSF, SFSU, He Lab	San Francisco, CA
Assistant Team Lead 	June-July 2022, July 2023
Designed and implemented summer course for 12 undergraduate and 3 graduate students. Investigated peroxisome and gland cell size in Pacific seaweeds over two summers.
Invented novel protocols for DNA staining in seaweed tissues. Designed and validated lab experiments for students before the start of the course. Performed reagent procurement, inventory management, and administrative tasks.  
Taught daily class and lab sessions for students involving DNA isolation, barcoding, sequencing, PCR, and gel electrophoresis. Ensured and analyzed student engagement with daily exit tickets. Nurtured critical thinking and experimental reasoning in students.
Managed twice the number of students as other lab teams with 8 out of 15 students inspired to continue research on the project during school year with positions in Prof. He’s laboratory. 
Published our results in microPublication Biology. 
Presented results to 11 other research groups at the CCC program unfamiliar with our model organism and work.
Our research focused on Asparagopsis taxiformis, a red seaweed with the potential to reduce methane emissions in ruminants by 95+% when used as a feed supplement. </p>
      <p>UCSF, Huang Lab	San Francisco, CA
Undergraduate Researcher on Placement  	 2021-2022
Gained professional lab experience researching heart regeneration in animal models. Independent research project involved identifying interactions between sympathetic nerves, brown fat tissue, and thyroid hormone with respect to regulating regenerative capacity in neonatal mice.
Delivered and validated the null hypothesis of my research - there is no significant interaction between sympathetic nerves, brown fat tissue, and thyroid hormone with respect to regulating regenerative capacity in neonatal mice. 3 previous lab members, including one post doc, failed to finish this project and deliver clear results. I succeeded where they had failed by juggling the complex tripartite drug injection schedule, breeding program, and tissue harvesting with a well designed research plan and organizational schedule. 
My duties included maintaining cultures of bacteria, performing growth assays, testing cell competence. Cultured and maintained mammalian cells lines, and utilized these for lentiviral culturing. Bred and managed 9 cages of genetically modified mouse lines and harvested hundreds for tissues samples. 
Utilized cryo-sectioning, immunostaining, fluorescent microscopy, PCR, and gel electrophoresis to collect results. Reviewed and edited unpublished journal articles. Kept dedicated lab notebook. Summarized research results weekly, elucidating new directions for future research or eliminating hypotheses. Trained 6 new lab members on lab protocols and techniques.
It was standard to work 6-7 days a week in this lab, my longest uninterrupted number of days was 45. </p>
